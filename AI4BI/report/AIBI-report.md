# AI for BI

Analyse data and provide a BI report including charts based on that data

We'll use CrewAI for the processing. This includes a Python interpreter which will be used to create the charts. You must have Docker installed locally to run the code automatically.

Running code generated by an LLM is potentially dangerous as there is n guarantee that the code wil be safe. Running the code in a Docker container, however, provides a sandbox for the code to run in and isolates it from the application code and local operating system.


Import the necessary libraries and set the LLM model (defaults to using OpenAI)


```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

llm = "gpt-4o-mini"
```


```python
files = [
    {
        'data_file_name':'sales_product_cat.csv',
        'chart_file_name': 'sales_product_summary.png',
        
    },
    {
        'data_file_name': 'monthly_sales.csv',
        'chart_file_name': 'monthly_sales.png',
    },
    {
        'data_file_name': 'sales_by_region.csv',
        'chart_file_name': 'sales_by_region.png',
    }
]
```


```python
import plotly.express as px
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv(files[0]['data_file_name'])
fig = px.bar(df,  x="Product Name", y="Revenue ($)", 
             color="Product Category", template="plotly_white")
fig.write_image(files[0]['chart_file_name'])

df = pd.read_csv(files[1]['data_file_name'])
fig = px.bar(df,  x="Month", y="Total Revenue ($)", 
             template="plotly_white")
fig.write_image(files[1]['chart_file_name'])

df = pd.read_csv(files[2]['data_file_name'])
fig = px.bar(df,  x="Region", y="Total Revenue ($)", 
             color = "Top-Selling Product", template="plotly_white")
fig.write_image(files[2]['chart_file_name'])
```

Import the tools required to read and write files


```python
from crewai_tools import tool
from crewai_tools import FileReadTool, FileWriterTool

# Initialize the tool to read any files the agents knows or lean the path for
file_read_tool = FileReadTool()
file_writer_tool = FileWriterTool()
```

Set up the ``data_analysis_agent``


```python
# Define the agent
data_analysis_agent = Agent(
        role="Data Analyser",
        goal="""You aim is to read and analyse sales data. You should
                then write a report on sales performance that includes an executive summary.
                """,

        allow_delegation=False,
        llm=llm,
        allow_code_execution=False
    )

```


```python
